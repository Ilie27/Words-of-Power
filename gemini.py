You are playing a metaphorical combat game, similar to rock-paper-scissors.

You are given a target word: "{noun}".
Your task is to decide which of the following 58 words could metaphorically, symbolically, or realistically "beat" the target word.

A word can "beat" another in many ways â€” it might overpower, break, contain, cure, counteract, replace, outlast, or symbolically dominate it. Be creative and flexible. Consider both poetic metaphors and real-world cause-effect relationships.

Here are the 58 candidate words:
{', '.join(your_words)}

Return ONLY a JSON array (not markdown) of the names of the words from the list above that beat "{noun}".

Example of valid output:
["Water", "Tsunami", "Cure", "Peace"]
